#setup
cd dotfiles
./install.sh


go through the git part then the openrc and systemd question
if you are using systemd type no and it will set up everything for systemd
if you are using openrc type yes and it will setup everything for openrc and all of the openrc package.
If you do not want my CompTIA A_+ 1002 exam notes then do the read the getting rid of my notes
then reboot you system
then if you want  flatpak then do:
./flatpak-install.sh




#iso part 
this are iso that are in a different drive

final ./insall.sh if you are not editing it anymore :)

spotify (music)
brave (web browser)
neovim (text editor)
sddm (login manager)
feh (for background)

#the weather module 
change the openweather line that says cityid
to find your cityid go to https://openweathermap.org 
search you city or town
if you are in new york city search that 
at the url there are numeber 
exsample for new york city the number in the url is 5128581
make sure it is still in ''. like this '5128581'
if you want metric just get rid of that line. If you want Imperial then put metric = False, at the beging of the module.
